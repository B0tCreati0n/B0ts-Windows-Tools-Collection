# B0t's Windows Tools
B0t's Windows Tools is a collection of tools for windows that all is either free for private (not free for commercial use) or completely free.  

Some of the folders in the root directory have their names changed to make more sense and improve organization.

## Best Practices for Running Programs

It is a good idea to copy-paste the programs into a separate folder when running them. This precaution is important because some programs create configuration files, and sharing the current folder with a friend or using it on another computer might lead to issues.  

Also, please be aware that certain programs might require them to be run in administrator mode to function properly.

## Dealing with Anti-Virus Flags

If your anti-virus flags a file or folder, it means that the software has detected something suspicious or potentially harmful. Taking these warnings seriously is crucial as they are designed to protect your system from potential threats.

However, not all flagged items are necessarily viruses. In some cases, legitimate programs or tools may trigger false positives due to the way they operate or because they exhibit behaviors that resemble malicious activities.

For example, password recovery tools may raise concerns from anti-virus software due to their access to your saved passwords. It's essential to view these situations from an anti-virus perspective and be cautious while using such tools.
