It is a good idea to copy paste the programs in a other folder than this when running them, 
some of them create a config file and if you give this folder to a friend or try use it on a other computer
you will maybe run into issues

Some of the folders in ROOT have their name changed so it make more sens

Also some programs require them to be run in administrator mode

My anti-virus flagged a file/folder. Is it a virus?

When your anti-virus flags a folder or a file, it means that the software has detected something suspicious or potentially harmful.
It is essential to take these warnings seriously, as they are designed to protect your system from potential threats.
However, it's important to note that not all flagged items are necessarily viruses. Sometimes legitimate programs or tools may trigger false positives due to the way they operate or because they exhibit behaviors that resemble malicious activities.
Fx if you use a password recovery tool, when has a legit program last required to get access to your saved passwords. Look at it from a anti-virus perspective.
