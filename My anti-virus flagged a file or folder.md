## Dealing with Anti-Virus Flags

If your anti-virus flags a file or folder, it means that the software has detected something suspicious or potentially harmful. Taking these warnings seriously is crucial as they are designed to protect your system from potential threats.

However, not all flagged items are necessarily viruses. In some cases, legitimate programs or tools may trigger false positives due to the way they operate or because they exhibit behaviors that resemble malicious activities.

For example, password recovery tools may raise concerns from anti-virus software due to their access to your saved passwords. It's essential to view these situations from an anti-virus perspective and be cautious while using such tools.
