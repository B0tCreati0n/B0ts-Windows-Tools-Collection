My anti-virus flagged a file/folder. Is it a virus?

When your anti-virus flags a folder or a file, it means that the software has detected something suspicious or potentially harmful.
It is essential to take these warnings seriously, as they are designed to protect your system from potential threats.
However, it's important to note that not all flagged items are necessarily viruses. Sometimes legitimate programs or tools may trigger false positives due to the way they operate or because they exhibit behaviors that resemble malicious activities.
Fx if you use a password recovery tool, when has a legit program last required to get access to your saved passwords. Look at it from a anti-virus perspective.
